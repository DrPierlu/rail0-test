# rail0-test

Integration tests for the RAIL0 payment gateway — direct HTTP endpoint tests and end-to-end flows via the supported clients (`rail0-go`; `rail0-cli`).

> Only the `rail0-go` and `rail0-cli` clients are in scope; the `ruby`, `python`,
> `rust`, `typescript` and `cross_sdk` suites were removed.

## Prerequisites

- Ruby ≥ 3.2 + Bundler (for the `api` suite)
- Go ≥ 1.22 (for the `go` suite)
- Test wallets with USDC on the target chain (Arc Testnet by default)
- The gateway running at `RAIL0_API_URL` with the test account registered

The client repos are expected as siblings of `rail0-test`:

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env with your test keys, API URL, account ID
```

## Running

```bash
# All suites
./run.sh

# Single suite
./run.sh api          # direct HTTP endpoint tests
./run.sh go           # rail0-go SDK flows
./run.sh cli          # drives the rail0 CLI binary
```

## API suite

`api/` tests the HTTP API directly without an SDK, using Ruby's standard `net/http`. They require a running rail0-gateway instance and the seeded test account. They cover:

| File | Endpoints tested |
|---|---|
| `auth_test.rb` | `POST /auth/nonces`, `POST /auth`, `GET /payments` (auth enforcement) |
| `accounts_test.rb` | `GET /accounts/:id/payment-methods`, `GET /accounts/:id/wallets`, `GET /accounts/:id/wallets/:id` |
| `payments_test.rb` | `GET /health`, `GET /payments/:id`, `POST /payments`, `PUT /payments/:id/sign` |
| `indexer_test.rb` | `POST /sync/transactions` (HMAC auth and input validation) |

Required env vars for the api suite (in addition to the common ones):

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `RAIL0_ACCOUNT_ID` | UUID of the seeded test account (fixed: `019e748b-da9a-7c3f-ba32-50572ffd5388`) |
| `RAIL0_INDEXER_HMAC_SECRET` | HMAC secret used to sign `/sync/transactions` requests |

## Flows covered

| Flow | Go (`rail0-go`) | CLI (`rail0-cli`) |
|---|---|---|
| authorize → capture → refund | ✓ | ✓ |
| charge | ✓ | ✓ |
| authorize → void | — | ✓ |
| partial capture ×2 → partial refund ×2 → release | — | ✓ |

> The release flow calls `release()` only after `authorizationExpiry`, so start
> the gateway with a short TTL (`POLICY_AUTHORIZATION_TTL=30`); otherwise the
> test waits the full default TTL before releasing.
